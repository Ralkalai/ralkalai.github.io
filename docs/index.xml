      <description>Bookshelf Below is a list of some of my favorite reads, this is not a comprehensive list nor is it static. You will also find what I’m currently enjoying.
Currently reading I am currently reading Deacon King Kong by James McBride. This incredible book made the list of the New York Times Book Review for 2020 and as a avid listener of The Book Review podcast I picked it up when it was first reviewed.</description>

      <description>Born and raised in Recife (Brazil) I now live in Vancouver on the traditional, unceded, and occupied territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, and səlilwətaɬ peoples. After many years in Recife, I was granted the opportunity to finish my secondary education at the United World College Costa Rica, where I fell in love with the study of biodiversity at multiple scales.
Although currently I’m just an undergraduate student, I intend on pursuing a career in academic research and teaching.</description>
